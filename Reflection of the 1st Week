This session began with a quick round of introductions and also where each one of us shared our views on why we chose this course as our Occupational Track and what we hoped to take away from this course. 
While listening to eveyone speak made me feel more connected to the group and it was actually very interesting to hear different perspectives and expectations as some of them were curious and a few like me were still exploring. I personally felt excited but at the same time was a bit unsure about what to expect. 
After the introductions, we were divided into the group of 5 members and was asked to step outside and explore the campus.
So, basically our task was to explore and observe our surroundings and note down the things which could be categorized under the term "technology". 
This activity was quite fun and also made me to see each and every objects very carefully and the interesting part was to notice the fact that how much of our life is surrounded and dependent on the technology which we usually don't notice it.
Back in the class, we discussed our findings briefly before the professor took the attendance and asked us to upload our group's list on Moodle.
The class ended on a light note as it was a very thoughtful and interactive session and I am looking forward to all the upcoming session, activities and also to look what comes next in the course
