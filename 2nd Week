In this class, we explored about how a computer works from the inside. We also looked at different parts like the Address Line/Bus and Data Line/Bus. These are the like the important parts of the computer that help the memory and CPU talk to each other and make the computer run properly. 
It was kind of very interesting to see that how each and every thing is connected and how it works together in order to move and manage the data.
One of the most fascinating things which we learned was how a computer understands information. 
We found that the computer can only understand binary numbers which are made up of 1s and 0s. We also learned about what is the difference between normal numbers i.e, decimal and binary numbers. 
The professor gave us an example on how to change normal numbers into binary numbers and vice-versa. Changing the normal numbers to binary numbers was quite fun as this was the new thing which I learnt during this session.

Converting a Decimal Number to Binary Number:
To convert 64 into binary, we used repeated division by 2 and noted the remainders:
64/2 = 32, remainder 0
32/2 = 16, remainder 0
16/2 = 8, remainder 0
8/2 = 4, remainder 0
4/2 = 2, reaminder 0
2/2 = 1, remainder 0
1/2 = 0, remainder 1
Now, we have to write the remainders from bottom to top: 
1000000
so, the binary representation of 64 is 1000000
Now converting a Binary Number to Decimal:
for instance, converting 1000000:
(1 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^5) + (0 x 2^4) + (0 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (0 x 2^0)
64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
64
so, 1000000 in binary number is equal to 64 in decimal number.
The professor gave us another question to convert the normal number to binary number and later we have to check the result by again coverting the binary number to the normal number and after this the class got over
